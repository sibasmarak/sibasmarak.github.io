       I was seating in a cafe, all alone, surrounded by people. I had ordered myself one cup of Cappuccino.
       <br><br>

       Cafes are a great place to get done with your work. You see so many people working and you either get motivated or feel guilty that you are getting behind and you put more efforts.
       Either way, you probably get your work done. It so happened that I was stuck on a problem - something that has been bugging me for the past week.
       Well, I rarely go to a cafe, however, with the above win situation in mind, I dragged myself to one. 
       Nevertheless, as it has been the case in the last week, I couldn't get past the problem.
    </tr>

    <hr/>

    <tr>
        The waiter brought my order. I took a sip from the cup and took the opportunity to look around.
        <br><br>
 
        So many people, engrossed in something or the other. From the person making the coffee to people building a new product. 
        From writers deep in their thought to people selling their products. It seemed everyone was busy in their own world.
        Then it suddenly hit me, how many of them are taking a pause to think about what they are doing, why they are doing, and more specifically, if it matters, 
        and more deeply, if they matter? I took a moment of pause. Took another sip.
        I realised that this question goes far deeper than most, if not all, of the things to ponder about.
    </tr>

    <hr/>

    <tr>
        I took one more sip. I didn't notice it before, but there was a tiny scratch on the cup.
        <br><br>

        Overwhelmed, I started looking outside the cozy little cafe to calm myself. Several people crossed the street to catch an incoming bus. 
        Unfortunately, some couldn't reach the bus stop in time and had to wait for the next one, which if I remember the schedule should be here within 10 minutes.
        The people who were waiting didn't seem to care much, as long as they reach their destination. It didn't matter which bus they chose. 
        Was it so easy to replace something? I don't think it worked, I mean, I don't think I calmed myself.
    </tr>

    <hr/>

    <tr>
        I took a deep breath and gulped. I never realised I could do this with a cup of coffee.
        <br><br>

        Am I replaceable? Huh, I literally looked outside to take my mind off the chain of thought, but as they say, the more the things change the more they stay the same.
        If I am not going to solve the research problem, someone else would come in the near future and solve it. 
        Even if I am going to solve it, someone would come and make it even better.
        Even if I find the best possible solution, the people may not look at it because they have far more important things to care about.

    </tr>

    <hr/>

    <tr>
        I raised the cup high enough so that I could drink the remaining coffee.
        <br><br>

        What would happen if the writer doesn't finish his writing? First, very few, if not none, would actually know about it. 
        Second, someone else could steal the theme and write a better piece on it. What would happen if she doesn't build the cool new product she is working on?
        Someone else would definitely do it, and if that doesn't happen, then nobody wanted it to happen in the very first place. How weird that you should
        stop working to definitively see the worth of what you are doing. With every single thought, it was getting more and more grim. I had made up my mind to this point that every single person can be replaced by
        someone else. For goodness sake, there are billions of people on this earth and it would not be difficult to find your replacement if at all it is required for the world to keep on
        moving.

    </tr>

    <hr/>

    <tr>
        There was a tap on my shoulder and the waiter asked if I was done. As I said yes, he took the cup from the table.
        <br><br>


        At this point, it again hit me. That very cup from which I drank, is like the most easiest thing to replace in this world.
        They could have just picked another random cup, and I wouldn't have even noticed. 
        But it did serve a purpose when it was with me, it carried the coffee so that I can drink comfortably.
        We do carry a purpose, or for that reason, we do matter, when we build relationships, when people rely on us for something.
        Hmm.., the whole meaning of our life, the meaning of our existence develops, if we can be there for someone and hopefully, someone for us too.

<section><h3>Epilogue</h3></section>
As Roy Batty (from Blade Runner) would say, "All this thought is just lost in time, like tears in rain". 
I'm still working and every other person is pushing themselves for what they care about hoping other people would eventually also care about similar things. 
It seems this chain of thought, is fruitless, ...or is it? Is someone else in the cafe also going through what I'm going through?
Why do we see so many people around, but in essence, we feel all alone and know almost nothing about others? 
Well, that's another problem to discuss which I won't. Well, not yet, I mean, I can't promise.
