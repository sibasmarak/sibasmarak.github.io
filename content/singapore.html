        I am Indian (most, if not all, of you know this fact). I need an e-Visa to enter Singapore (accurate in 2025). 
        Who knows, Indian passport might become more powerful in the future. I hope this comment ages well.
        
        <ul>
            <li><u>e-Visa</u></li>
            <ul>
                <li>I applied for the e-Visa from Switzerland. Generally, it takes <b>2-5 working days</b> to get the e-Visa. However, it took
                about <b>3 weeks</b> for many students traveling to ICLR 2025 from Switzerland.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Application requirements</b>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Application form 14A
                            (<a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/forms/form14a.pdf?sfvrsn=b201f1d9_32" target="_blank">link</a> 
                            from official <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/" target="_blank">ICA</a> website)</li>
                        <li>One colour passport-sized photograph (within last 3 months)</li>
                        <li>Photocopy of passport's biodata page and cover page</li>
                        <li>Return/onward flight details</li>
                        <li>Booking confirmation from the hotel in Singapore</li>
                        <li>Swiss permanent residence card/valid Schengen visa</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    → I submitted the documents physically in Geneva.<br>
                    → Passport should be valid for > 6 months from entry into Singapore. <br>
                    → Additional optional documents to strengthen your application - letter of explanation (especially, if you are staying before and after the actual trip) and proof of financial means for duration of stay.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Permanent Mission of Singapore (at Geneva)</b> was pretty responsive on phone and email (more on phone). I used +41 22 795 01 01 to call and 
                    MFA_GVA_WTO@mfa.gov.sg to email. Fun fact, I had to call from India to ask about visa status. I don't know how much I paid for that international call
                    but got the confirmation that my visa was approved :) </li>
                <br>
                <li>You should receive your <b>e-Visa on email</b> (well, it is "e"-visa, so make sure your email is correct), if approved.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <li><u>SG Arrival Card (SGAC)</u></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Extremely important</b> to enter Singapore. Use <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/">MyICA Mobile App</a> 
                        to submit the SGAC within 3 days before your arrival. If you are arriving on 10th, you can submit the SGAC on, 
                        8th, 9th, or 10th of the same month.</li> 
                    <li>Once filled, you can scan the QR-code from the app at the immigration kiosk and give your biometric information to enter.</li>
                    <li>After your entry, you can retrieve your <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/at-our-checkpoints/for-travellers/retrieval-of-electronic-visit-pass" target="_blank">e-Pass</a>.
                        You should receive an email also. I was not asked to show it, but this is the proof of your arrival and lists your allowed maximum stay.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                Also, look into official <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/entering-singapore/visa_requirements" target="_blank">Entry Requirements</a> for more details.

                        <li>For short term stays, you can use credit card for <b>payment</b>. Just tap in and out. 
                            It will automatically deduct the price as per distance travelled.</li>

                <b>Overall personal verdict</b> - it is good, pricey, great time with friends, and some amazing rides. Spoilers below!

                <ul>
                    <li><u>The Lost World</u>: "Rapids" was good in the very last part when there is a sudden drop. "Canopy Flyer" was chill and very short.</li>
                    <li><u>Sci-fi city</u>: "Battlestar Galatica: Human vs. Cylon" is the GOAT! I don't know how people do it. I didn't. "Accelerator" was chill. "Transformers - The Ride" was unexpectedly amazing.</li>
                    <li><u>Ancient Egypt</u>: I swear man, we need to talk about "Revenge of the Mummy". It starts so slow, and then bing-bop-boom-boom-bop-bam. It was crazy. The jeeps moved too slow in "Treasure Hunter", so didn't go.</li>
                    <li><u>Minion Land</u>: Okay-ish. Great for people who really appreciate Minions.</li>
                    <li><u>Far Far Away</u>: Fancy places to take dreamy pictures.</li>
                </ul>            
                
                <br>
                <u>Final tips</u>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Book online tickets</b>. It is cheaper. We booked from <a href="https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/117-universal-studios-singapore/" target="_blank">Klook Travel</a>.</li>
                    <li>You can have lunch inside, there are some restaurants. </li>
                    <li><b>Plan on a week-day</b>. It is less crowded. We went on a Wednesday. 
                        Between 1 pm - 4 pm, we did only 2 rides (~30 mins wait time).
                        Between 4 pm - 7 pm, we did 6 rides (non-existent wait time). 
                        So, it is better to go on a week-day and later in the afternoon.</li>
                    </li>
                    <li>Take rest in between rides, hydrate yourself, and just chill and take many photos. 
                        We spotted the velociraptor in the evening near the Lost World, so it was a good ending for me :) </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            I couldn't explore other parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentosa" target="_blank">Sentosa Island</a>. It is highly recommended though.

                        Happens at the Supertree Grove. 
                        It is a 15 mins show (one at 7.45 pm, next at 8.45 pm). 
                        After the first show, an artificial Aurora environment was made. 
                        The show was so nice, I had to do it twice! 
                    </li>

                    <li><a href="https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/things-to-do/attractions/ocbc-skyway.html" target="_blank">OCBC Skyway</a>:
                        A tad bit pricey, but there are nice spots to take pictures. You can stay as long as you want.
                        Some people actually observe the Light and Music show from there. You can observe one show from here and next by lying on the ground.
                        Let me know the difference in experience.</li>

                    <li><a href="https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/things-to-do/attractions/cloud-forest.html" target="_blank">Cloud Forest</a>:
                        Again, a bit pricey, but beautiful spots to take pictures and enjoy an artificial rainforest.
                        Heard on the streets that they are opening new attraction from May 28, 2025 - "Jurassic World: The Experience"

                    <li>I missed the "The Creatures of the Night" show at the <b>amphitheatre</b> because the last show is at 9.30 pm. So visit before.</li>
                    <li>The best part are the <b>trails</b>. The late in the night you visit them, the more <b>spooky</b> and <b>eerie</b> they are. All the four trails are connected.</li>
                    <li><u>Pangolin Trail</u> - Saw pangolin, returned from the middle to meet with friends.</li>
                    <li><u>Tasmanian Devil Trail</u> - good trail to get familiar with what comes next.</li>
                    <li><u>East Lodge Trail</u> - got too real.
                        It was dark, almost isolated, and a jump away from hyenas. We were surprised they didn't jump.
                        The guard guessed that they won't because they haven't. Logic 101 :). There was white tiger too!</li>
                    <li><u>Leopard Trail</u> - Leopard was difficult to spot. Malayan flying foxes were crazy.</li>
                    <li>You can have dinner inside, there are a few restaurants.</li>
