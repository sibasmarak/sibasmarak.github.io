# A Framework for analyzing FB posts during Elections

The internship was under the guidance of following eminent people:
- [Dr. Kiran Garimella](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/kiran-garimella/), IDSS, MIT, USA
- [Prof. Aaditya Dar](https://www.isb.edu/en/research-thought-leadership/faculty/faculty-directory/aaditya-dar.html), ISB Hyderabad
- [Dr. Vasundhara Sirnate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasundhara_Sirnate), The Polis Project

# Current Status
### Work done by [Siba Smarak Panigrahi](https://sibasmarak.github.io/) in the month of Dec 2020 - Jan 2021

The following description is extremely brief. To use this framework, look through the codes or [read this](https://github.com/sibasmarak/elections/blob/master/framework/README.md)
.
- Creates a comprehensive dictionary of posts from a set of .txt files
- Can perform basic analysis on variation of posts of time, reactions, captions, and trending posts
- Create classifiers (currently Logistic Regression - you can very easily switch it :sweat_smile:) for
    - top 8 (as per the posts released) contesting parties
    - any two contesting parties 
    - MGB and NDA
- Topic modeling and visualization of topics of any subset posts. Helper functions to ease topic modeling are available for
    - posts which are not related to any party
    - posts related to any particular party
    
#### Note: The work was done with the aid of `Google Colaboratory Notebooks` and free GPU resources available.

# FAQs
### 1. Wait, you said Google Colab. Can I get the link to it?
**Ans**: Definitely. But it is kind of rough and a bit muddled up. Still, if you wish to refer the Colab notebook (at your own risk :sweat_smile: :stuck_out_tongue:), here you go: [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IkqECHTIL-41i_Xeh7wmrGXLSodd2mEf?usp=sharing). If you find discrepancy with the final functions available here, then, I am really sorry, I have warned. `Colab is rough work mostly - but provides a fair idea how to use the functions available in the framework`!

### 2. Hey, I have an important query. I want to use your functions in framework directory. But, where is the data? Is it publicly available?
**Ans**. Hey! It is really wonderful to hear that you want to use my framework, to analyze and design classifiers for FB posts released during elections! :heart_eyes:  
I am extremely sorry :disappointed_relieved:. The data could not be made public since the work is in progress. Hope you understand!    
But, we have the shared the framework, so yay :wink::star_struck:!

### 3. I have some additional FAQs.
**Ans**: Do contact the author of the code!
