                <li>When you want <b>someone to review your SOP</b>, share the draft with graduate students and if you get a chance (and feel confident), with your current university professors (by asking if they are available to review it or not).</li>
                <li>When you want <b>to feel overwhelmed</b>, talk with friends who are also applying to universities widely different than you (hence making you think if you are applying to correct universities or not).</li>

                You should (or must) stand on shoulders of geniuses (graduate applicants who were successful)!
                I might be repeating this point, but it is worth repeating. Do reach out to seniors (in your interested universities) to ask about their
                <b>experience so far, lab environment, and funding opportunities (for MSc programs mainly)</b>. Additionally, after you are accepted, 
                ask about food, weather, people, commute, and survival tips. However, <b>do not ask about nitty gritty details of application process</b>, because it might have changed since their time 
                and they could unknowingly share wrong information (as mentioned earlier, there are specific people from the university who could help regarding this).

                A classic dialogue! 
                You would have so many (did I write many? it should be 'many many many' honestly) options that you must think 'if you should apply' to this
                particular position rather than 'if you could apply'. Always remember that you have <b>finite number of LORs</b> and thus an important task is to 
                <b>select which labs or universities would best align your interests and your final goal</b> (most importantly, you should see where the alumni are).
                When applying to a specific university think (in the following order)
                <ul>
                    <li>is there another opportunity to which I should redirect my energy and application materials rather than here?</li>
                    <li>if I get an accept from here, would it be my dream come true?</li>
                    <li>if I get an accept from here, how happy will I be?</li>

        <td width="70%">
            Ah, one of the classic lines! What is better than this line to (almost) conclude. In admits decision cycle 
            <ul>
            <li>If you get some early accepts, before accepting, wait till almost all the decisions are out (or there is a deadline to submit your acceptance).</li>
            <li>If you get some early rejects, there is hope that you would get an acceptance late in the cycle.</li>
            <li>If you get all rejects, there are a ton of other opportunities - AI Residency programs, 
            Research Fellowships and special (research) programs from industry to name a few 
            (<a href="https://github.com/ankitshah009/all-about-ai-residency" target="_blank">This</a> and 
            <a href="https://github.com/dangkhoasdc/awesome-ai-residency" target="_blank">this</a> link might be helpful).</li>
            </ul>
